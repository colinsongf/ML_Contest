4. Will go and find how to use weka for random trees tomorrow

5. Validation set in data 

*******************************************************************************************************************************

1. Handle the missing attributes.
A total of 4930 attributes are NaN in 1897 x 3500 input values.
No label is missing.

2. There is a high class imbalance.
label 		numberOfPoints
1			700
2			2800

6. the weights for the classes 


3. Feature extraction can be done as there are many features
LDA , PCA

missing values
normalize data
class weights
extract features

should we normalize first and then extract and then again normalize or is that the other way around ?
